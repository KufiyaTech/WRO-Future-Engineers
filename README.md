## Our vehicle: 

We used the EV3 MINDSTORMS Educational kit. We chose to use a racing car shape so it could move fluidly and dodge the obstacles

A 3D model of the robot made in Studio 2.0 can be found here:

The final program/code for our autonomous vehicle can be found here:

## Mobility Management

### Motor Selection and role
Choosing the motors is an important step to build the vehicle. We used only 1 big motor for the main movemement so the robot can be smaller and a mid motor for the steering mechanism so it allows the robot to turn easily while moving forward.
### Chassis 

We tried to copy f1 vehicles shape.The steering mechanism is located in the front, utilizes smaller wheels. Additionally, positioning the larger wheels as close to each other as possible, for more stability and agility.

### Sensors

Our vehicle is simple,with only two color sensor crucial for obstacle avoidance and turns.

Color Sensor1: This sensor is employed to identify turns and determine the driving direction by reading colored lines (orange or blue) on the competition field.
Color Sensor2: This sensor is employed to identify the obstacles either red or green
